This folder contains some notes and algorithm implementation from Digital video lectures and some general video processing tasks. 

1. For Block Matching algorithm, two frames, i.e. frame10.png and frame11.png, are provided here. Other than this feel free to download more samples and ground truth from Middlebury Dataset. I have also data the a part of that dataset here since it's small in size, follow other-data-gray/gt-flow/gt-inter-gray. 

2. Fleet Jepson work is more theoretical; implementation is also provided here but may have some bugs in it. please free to raise issue and merge PRs. 

3. Video Statistics are dealt in divisive normalization notebook; I performed some simple weighted gaussian normalization and compared the correponding reduction in redundancy in scene/features. Also, for sample video, you may use any yuv file but here I used a sample 8-bit HD raw video from UVG dataset, feel free to explore that as well. 

4. I will add and update more implementations soon.
